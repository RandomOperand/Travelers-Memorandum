  Hello there! If you've made it to this page, you've found my personal blog used as a recollection of my journey through Japanese immersion content. Here, you'll find questionably written reviews within Japanese as output practice, and, of course, a simple memorandum (dare I say, a traveler's memorandum) of my experiences with the language. Start out with the introductory page for more or less the same briefing. Thank you for your time, and don't expect anything incredible here.
