        <h2>About the Blog</h2>
        <p>As you might've seen in the README.md, the Traveler's Memorandum is a small, personal project I've endeavored in to improve my Japanese output, and provide ample motivation for my journey, as well as your own.<br></p>
        <p>Since around 1/6/2025, I began learning Japanese through the Kaishi 1.5k deck, initially at 10 card reviews per day before increasing that amount to 22 as my recognition of word structure grew. Since 4/2/2025 (indeed, the day prior to the blog's development), I have finished the Kaishi deck and have moved onto sentence mining and immersion. As immersion has become my primary goal, I have opted to create the blog you are currently reading. I'll occasionally share things that I find interesting (perhaps the occassional analysis or grammar point), along with posts regarding various pieces of media in some form; as of now, a Log Horizon manga chapter-by-chapter review is planned.<br></p>
        <p>Check out the index page for a list of currently available posts! Apologies if the page structuring is a bit disorganizedâ€”such is the language learning process; we'll call it reflective.</p>
